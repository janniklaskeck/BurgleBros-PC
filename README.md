# Burgle Bros. PC
My implementation of the tabletop game "Burgle Bros." (https://www.fowers.games/products/burgle-bros) by Tim Fowers.

Most functionality is realised in C++, while most UI or Debug related things are done in Blueprints.

A simple Game Manual can be found in the file "Game-Manual.txt" next to this file.
It describes the most important aspects of the game but doesn't go into all details.

This game probably isn't bug free but it should be mostly playable from start to finish.
If any bugs occur please open an issue or write me an email.

## Download

You can find a download link of a binary package for Windows under the release tab (https://github.com/janniklaskeck/BurgleBros-PC/releases)

### Installation

Extract the contents of the .zip file to a location of your liking.
Inside you'll find a "BurgleBros.exe", which will start the game.

## Tools
Unreal Engine 4.21 is the used Engine.

Visual Studio 2017 is used for all coding related tasks.
