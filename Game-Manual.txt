# Game Rules
You're a group of specialist burglars breaking into the Office building of a successful bank.
You have to overcome all obstacles awaiting you inside the building without being caught by the guards.

# Attention
The rules of this game are almost exactly the same as of the tabletop game.
Some were changed or omitted.

## Controls
All actions are controllable with the mouse.
The main interaction is with the action bar at the lower edge of the screen.
It contains the following actions, in order: Move, Peek, Use Room, Use Ability, Use Tool, End Turn.
The Move and Peek actions additionaly have two smaller buttons above them for moving/peeking up or down.
Other interactions are displayed in the middle of the screen.
Camera movement is possible with WASD or moving the mouse to the window edges, zooming is controlled by the mouse wheel.
Q and E allow moving between the different floors (down and up respectively).

### Cheats
Cheats are available via pressing F1 during gameplay.
A small popup will display all cheat options.

## Goal
Crack all three safes and carry the loot up to the roof where you'll be extracted via helicopter.
If any one player is caught by a guard, you have lost.

## Turn Order
The Turn Order consists of:
1. Player Turn
2. Check for Event
3. Guard Turn

### Player Turn
Each burglar starts with 3 Stealth tokens at the beginning of the game.
If the burglar moves into a room with a Guard (or vice-versa), he or she will lose one Stealth token.
**If the burgler is supposed to lose a token but isn't possing another one the game is over and the player loses!**
Each burglar starts with 4 actions which can be used in a few ways:

#### Move
Move from one room to another(not through walls).
The target room will be revealed if it isn't already.
Certain rooms, such as Laser or Walkway rooms, apply a certain effect when entering while being unrevealed(i.e. Laser room causes Alarm).
If a Room contains Stairs(up or down) the burglar can also move in these directions.
If a previously unvisited floor is entered, the guard for this floor will be revealed, including the initial patrol path.

#### Peek
Reveal an adjacent room without moving into it.
Safer than directly moving into it but also slower,
Room abilities are not triggered when revealing them via peeking.

#### Crack Safe
Safe rooms are the most important rooms for winning the game.
Each Safe room has a unique combination which must be cracked by the burglars.
The combination is based on the rooms which are in the same row or column as the safe.
Each room contains a single number which together build the Safe combination.
These rooms must be revealed to reveal their combination number.
A Safe can only be cracked if the whole combination is known.

##### Add die to safe
Costs 2 actions. Adds a die to the safe, available for rolling the combination.

##### Roll dice on safe
Roll all dice available in the Safe room.
If the number of any roll matches a number of the rooms responsible for the combination, this room number is considered cracked.
This action can be used even if not all necessary rooms are revealed.
If a number is already cracked and a new room is revealed with the same number, this number has to be rolled again.
Rolled dice remain in the room and successful results are saved.

###### Safe Cracked
If the whole combination is rolled successfully the burglar responsible for this will receive one Loot item and draws a Tool.
The Guard of the Safe's floor and all floors below gain one additional movement range permanently.

#### Character Ability
Each burgler is a specialist in his or her field.
Some of these specializations are in the form of active abilities while others are passive.
Depending on the ability, they'll cost an action or not.
These abilities can only be used once per turn.

#### Tools
Using Tools costs no action and once used they are gone.
Tools help the burglars to overcome the dangers in the building.

### Check for Event Turn
If any burglar ends his turn with two or more actions, he or she has to draw an Event.
These Events can be good or bad (or do nothing) but they always bear a certain risk.

### Guard Turn
Once the possible Event is handled it's time for the Guard of the floor to move.
Each guard has a certain movement range, ranging from two to six.
They start with two for the first, three for the second and four for the third floor.
Their patrol destinations are randomly drawn from a deck containing all rooms of the floor.
If this deck is used up, they gain one additional movement, re-shuffle the deck and draw a new destination.
This means a guard won't visit the same room again until the deck is re-shuffled.
